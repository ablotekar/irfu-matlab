Directory for non-MATLAB files related to software "BIA_QL3" for generating official BIAS quicklooks/summary plots.
The software is delivered to ROC/LESIA for execution there.


USAGE
=====
Main bash script: bia_ql3
Syntax 1: --help
Syntax 2: matlab_executable YYYYMMDD input_bia_path input_lfr_wf_e_path output_dir log_dir


NOTE
====
According to ROC (Milan Maksimovic, LESIA):
    "Summary Plot" (SP) = Plot which summarizes the content of a single dataset
    "Quicklook"         = Plot which summarizes data for entire instrument.
Hence this code generates what he calls "summary plots" and MATALB package "solo.sp".
However, ROC has named the software "BIA_QL3" (QL=Quicklooks? L3?!) so the usage is inconsistent.
